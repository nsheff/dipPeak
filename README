dipPeak

DipPeak is a parzen or kernel density estimator for high-throughput sequencing data. Please see the R documentation for additional details.


#At the cost of more CPU use and some scratch space, you can estimate the cutoff
#using all data, instead of a different cutoff based on each
#individual chromosome. This is highly recommended, since sometimes single 
#chromosome cutoffs can lead to weird results.
#GENOME_WIDE_CUTOFF = TRUE;
