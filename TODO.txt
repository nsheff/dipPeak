-Add read length parameter. For dnase, it makes sense to just consider the reads at length 1, which is what I'm doing now. But this needs to be a parameter.

-Allow for noise supression. For really weak regions that are clearly clearly clearly not peaks, I should just eliminate the signal track alltogether, so save space (making the density output sparse).

-Maybe make a default setting for dnase, and one for chip? It looks like chip would do better with a wider window.

-for chip.

-add in background correction files for strange copy number cell lines? (like fseq)

-correct for mappability?


maybe I could have used binary file writing instead of extending to C.
zz = file(bwFile, "rb")
rb = readBin(zz)
readBin(zz, integer(), 500000000, size=8)
writeBin("test.out", cov)
